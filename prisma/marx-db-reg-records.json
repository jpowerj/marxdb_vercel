Note: M’s revision and rewriting of the German original, for this edn, are far more extensive than commonly realized, and this French version has never been given its due attention, even though M wrote that “it possesses a scientific value independent of the original and should be consulted even by readers familiar with German” [#M132]; cf. also #M131, and letter to Danielson (May 28,1872) and to Sorge (June 21, 1872).

Its subtitle was: “A critical analysis of capitalist production.” All subseq English edns were based on this “authorized edition,” with exceptions to be noted.

(++) M’s work on political economy eventuating in Capital goes back to 1844. This story has been essayed in a number of books, such as (in descending order of completeness) Rosdolsky's The making of Marx’s Capital, E. Mandel’s Formation of the economic thought of KM, Vygodsky’s A book for all time, and the editors’ prefaces to ST/M47 and ST/M48. For a chronology, see “The Road to Capital” (Appendix to the Chronicle). Even while writing Capital M changed his plans more than once; but in the last stage he made a first draft, covering all volumes, from Aug 1863 to the end of 1865. This was revised with a view to publ in JanFeb 1866. Then M decided to concentrate on preparing vol. 1 for publ; this took from Feb 1866 to Apr 1867, followed by some revision and addition in June and (for the preface) July.

In this respect one of the fullest is the Struik edn (ST/ME9). Also, different editions are variously edited for style in punctuation, spelling, and other technical features, including the choice of title (CM or M of the CP). —MECW 6:477 presents the 1888 \"authorized English translation\" with copious footnotes on variations from the original German (but not complete); MEGA also offered a list of these variations, even less completely.

Lawrence (CPC edns) from ca. 1932 on; Moscow’s FLPH from ca. 1954 on, and Prog Pub more recently; Peking’s Foreign Languages Press from 1965 on; Pathfinder Press (intro by Trotsky), 1970. —Special editions have been kept in print by others: the SPGB (London) pubd a 1948 edn, The Communist Manifesto, and the Last Hundred Years: Monthly Review Press pubd it with #E620 plus an essay (ST/ME13); an edn outfitted with an essay by H. J. Laski has appeared in various versions (see ST/42). — Since the Manifesto began appearing on college reading lists, various commercial editions have multiplied, often accompanied by decontaminating intros: by Penguin (Pelican Bks), 1967, intro by A. J. P. Taylor; Regnery, 1955, © 1954, Gateway edn, intro by S. T. Possony; Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1955, ed by S. H. Beer; Washington Square Press, 1964, intro by F. B.

Laski has appeared in various versions (see ST/42). — Since the Manifesto began appearing on college reading lists, various commercial editions have multiplied, often accompanied by decontaminating intros: by Penguin (Pelican Bks), 1967, intro by A.
